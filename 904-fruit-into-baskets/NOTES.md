**Algorithm**
1.  Create and HashMap
2.  traverse till the total trees
2.1 Store each fruit in HashMap
2.2 check if map size is strictly greater than 2
if it is then decrease the count of that fruit and check if count if equal to 0
if count becomes equals to 0 then erase that element from map
2.3 Increment i
3. return the result j-i
